The following projects are the experimental projects I have done in the past in the field of measurement, machinery condition monitoring and diagnosis:
1) [Designing and Manufacturing a Test setup for predicting the Remaining Useful Life of ball bearings (University of Calgary)](https://github.com/hajnayeb/RUL/tree/main)
2) [Cavitation detection in centrifugal pumps using instantaneous angular speed of a pump using an encoder (Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz)](https://github.com/hajnayeb/IAS-Cav/tree/main)
3) [Cavitation detection in centrifugal pumps using vibration and machine learning](https://github.com/hajnayeb/Vib-Cav)
4) [Applying Blade Tip Timing (BTT) methods for measuring blades vibration]
5) [Rub-impact detection in rotors using torsional vibrations]
